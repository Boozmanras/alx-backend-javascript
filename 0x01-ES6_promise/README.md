# ES6 Promises Project

## Overview
This project is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum. It focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 Promises in JavaScript. The project consists of several tasks that cover various aspects of working with Promises, including creating, resolving, rejecting, and chaining Promises, as well as using async/await syntax.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple JavaScript files, each addressing a specific aspect of Promises:

1. `0-promise.js`: Basic Promise creation
2. `1-promise.js`: Promise resolution and rejection
3. `2-then.js`: Handling Promise resolution and rejection
4. `3-all.js`: Working with multiple Promises
5. `4-user-promise.js`: Creating a Promise that resolves with user data
6. `5-photo-reject.js`: Creating a Promise that always rejects
7. `6-final-user.js`: Handling multiple Promises and returning results
8. `7-load_balancer.js`: Implementing a simple load balancer with Promises
9. `8-try.js`: Error handling with try/catch
10. `9-try.js`: Advanced error handling and function wrapping
11. `100-await.js`: Using async/await syntax

## Setup and Testing
To set up and test this project:

1. Ensure you have Node.js 12.11.x installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Use the command `npm run dev <filename>` to run each file, e.g., `npm run dev 0-main.js`.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Creating and using Promises
- Promise chaining
- Error handling in Promises
- Concurrent Promise handling (Promise.all, Promise.race)
- Async/await syntax
- Try/catch blocks with Promises

## Requirements
- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the .js extension
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command npm run test
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- All of your functions must be exported
