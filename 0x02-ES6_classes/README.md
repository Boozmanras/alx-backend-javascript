# ES6 Classes Project

This project explores various concepts of ES6 classes in JavaScript. It includes implementations of different classes demonstrating inheritance, getters, setters, static methods, and more.

## Project Structure

- `0-classroom.js`: Basic class implementation
- `1-make_classrooms.js`: Function to create multiple class instances
- `2-hbtn_course.js`: Class with getters, setters, and type-checking
- `3-currency.js`: Class with method implementation
- `4-pricing.js`: Class that uses composition
- `5-building.js`: Abstract class implementation
- `6-sky_high.js`: Class extending an abstract class
- `7-airport.js`: Class with custom string representation
- `8-hbtn_class.js`: Class with custom primitive conversion
- `9-hoisting.js`: Fix for class hoisting issues
- `10-car.js`: Class with cloning method using Symbol.species
- `100-evcar.js`: Class extending Car with privacy considerations

## Key Concepts Covered

- ES6 class syntax
- Getters and setters
- Static methods
- Class inheritance
- Method overriding
- Symbol.species
- Abstract classes
- Type checking in classes
- Class composition

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 12.11.x)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run individual files: `npm run dev <filename>`

## Testing

Tests for each implementation are provided in the corresponding main files (e.g., `0-main.js`, `1-main.js`, etc.).
